# GraphMatchingSubstitutionMatrices

Code and data repository for the GMSM (Graph Matching Substitution Matrices) model from the RECOMB 2024 paper "Structure- and Function-Aware Substitution Matrices via Learnable Graph Matching". The model learns substitution matrices for biochemical structures over structural alphabets based on class labels (functional information).

| *Architecture of GMSM. (a) Biochemical structures are transformed into graphs. (b) For each graph, its nodes are represented as a structure-aware embeddings using the same GNN. (c) The model computes the substitution matrix from node embeddings and obtains the graph alignment with respect to the learned substitution matrix.*|
